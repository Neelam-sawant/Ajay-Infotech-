In addition to that, the same Escape key will let you close TallyPrime, with a confirmation. Similarly, you can use different key combinations to achieve what you want. In fact, you can navigate and use TallyPrime features completely using a keyboard.

Data entry for recording different types of transactions are made similar to enhance learning, and retention of knowledge. Master creation is made simple by using similar actions wherever possible, and multiple ways to reach the create options.

Reports are presented in a hierarchical manner for easy analysis. While TallyPrime provides a large number of reports, reading and understanding the reports are simplified with similar interactions. When you open a report, you will get the summary data for the most relevant report period. From there you can change the report period, presentation format, and so on, up to the value that forms the basis of the report. Consistent interactions make it easier for you to navigate, and memorise the steps.

Sharing data in printed formats, or in electronic file formats through e-mail, WhatsApp or export is one of the useful TallyPrime features available by default.
